Wiggle is a TypeScript DSL for modular sound design. It works by wrapping the
Web Audio API and providing functions that perform the roles of traditional
synthesizer components.

## How to run

```
npm install
npm run build     # Build the song defined in song.ts
npm run serve     # Serve in your web browser 
```
